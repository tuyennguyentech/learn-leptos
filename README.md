# Learn Leptos web framework

In this project, i will follow the [Leptos's book](https://book.leptos.dev/), walk through the fundamental concepts to build applications, beginning with a simple rendered in browser, and building toward a full-stack application with server-side rendering and hydration.

Leptos is most similar to framworks like [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) (JavaScript) and [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/) (Rust). There are some similarities to other frameworks like React (JavaScript), Yew (Rust), and Dioxus (Rust).

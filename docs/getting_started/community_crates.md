# The Leptos Community and leptos-* Crates

## The Community

One final note before we get to building with Leptos: if you haven't already, feel free to join the growing community on the Leptos [Discord](https://discord.gg/YdRAhS7eQB) and on [Github](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos). Our Discord channel in particular is very active and friendly - we'd love to have you there!

## Leptos-* Crates

The community has built a growing number of Leptos-related crates that will help you get productive with Leptos projects more quickly - check out the list of crates built on top of Leptos and contributed by the community on the [Awesome Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/awesome-leptos) repo on Github.

If you want to find the newest, up-and-coming Leptos-related crates, check out the "Tools and Libraries" section of the Leptos Discord. In that section, there are channels for the Leptos view! macro formatter (in the "leptosfmt" channel); there's a channel for the utility library "leptos-use"; another channel for the UI component library "thaw-ui"; and a "libraries" channel where new leptos-* crates are discussed before making their way into the growing list of crates and resources available on [Awesome Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/awesome-leptos).
